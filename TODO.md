- entry point with various placeholder commands
  - ~~browse-ticker~~
  - ~~download-quotes~~
  - ~~gain~~
  - ~~next-research~~
    - ~~note: this is actually a shell script that calls stock-notes oldest. Let's keep the functionality the same for now and refactor later if we want to.~~
  - calc
    - this is a completely independent program that should probably exists separately from stock notes
    - rewrite this sometime in the future if I want to deprecate this
    - at a minimum I should make sure that this functionality still works in my stock note editor of choice
  - keywords
    - might be useful but let that one wait for later
- ~~command line options are parsed and help is displayed~~
  - ~~I looked at various scala command line libraries. They seem to provide complex DSLs to solve the taks. I'm going to start just by implementing it myself in raw scala. It's possible this will be the clearest solution.~~
- ~~configuration file has necessary data~~
  - ~~log dir, cash dir, notify quotes file, buy sell quotes file, temp file (???), no cik url, finnhub access key~~
  - ~~make this a high level object, maybe we can just read JSON from a dot file in the home directory~~
- IO object
  - I'm not sure if we need this. It would be created at a hight level and passed down.
  - The alterative is to have each command handle whatever IO it needs to do and build the functions in a way that allows easy testing.
  - I think most IO results in a failure of the command so it may not matter.
- parse everything
  - ~~date~~
  - notify (maybe don't need this)
  - ~~fraction~~
  - shares
  - stocks
  - quotes
  - price
  - cash
  - buysell
  - trade
- Hierarchy / Typeing
  - ~~Quote(price: Double, date: Date)~~
    - need special parser for CSVs; makes sense for this to be close to the quote download file not date
    - object method to load the existing cache of tickers
    - object method to download a list to directory (may need a list of quotes) I wonder how we generate our list for this
      - I can punt on this if I need the other objects first
  - ~~Quotes(List[Quote])~~
    - I'm not sure if we need a structure for this, just a CSV parser; it should probably be part of the CSV Download package
  - ~~I think it's time to refactor the ticker String into a case class~~
  - ~~CashAccount(date: Date, balance: Int)~~
    - balance is stored as dollars*100 (pennies)
    - object method to load a list from the dir
  - ~~price(price: Double, mult:Fraction)~~
    - toStr does not seem to honor the multple. Is this intentional?
    - I didn't fully implement this; I have some questions so let's see how it is used first
  - Shares(shares: Int, Mult: Fraction)
    - I'm goint to call this Stock, nope, left it as shares
  - Entry(ticker: Ticker, date: Date, text: String)
    - this is every dated entry of every company
    - I don't think they're in chronological order so I'm not sure what they're used for
    - I'm going to try to put this in the case class for Stock (was Company) and see what will happen. Why do that? Leave it as it's own class.
  - Trade abstract base class, I guess a trait
    - Buy(date: Date, shares: Shares, price: Price, commission: Double)
    - Sell(date: Date, shares: Shares, price: Price, commission: Double)
    - strangely parsing is returning the balance but it's not part of the data structure
      - I think it's just an assertion for the parsing
    - Split(date: Date, mult: Fraction)
    - Dividend has not been used at all so leave it out
  - Buysell
    - These are the four ranges to put stocks in. I really hate the name of this. I'm goint to change this to Alert.
    - Watch(buyLow: Price, buyHigh: Price, sellLow: Price)
  - Company(ticker: String, name: String, cid: Option[String], entries: List[Entry], trades: List[Trade], keywords: Set[String])
    - This could be called Stock. Don't change it for now. Change it!
    - there is a global list of Companies as well as a global list of entries which is used by oldest, html_index, and bydate
  - Data
    - I don't know what to call this; something besides data; All, 
    - I this this should contain (companies: Map[String, Company], cashAccounts: Map[String, CashAccount], quotes: Map[String, Quote])
    - might as well throw configuration into it since that is what builds it
