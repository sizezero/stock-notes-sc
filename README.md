# Stock Notes

A set of scripts that organize various stock investment notes.  This is fairly specific to my research style and is unlikely useful to anyone else.

This is a reimplementation of the original Python `stock-notes` project in Scala.

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
